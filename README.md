## Features

- **Timeline View**  
  A horizontal timeline UI to browse skip sizes.
- **Grid View**  
  An enhanced grid layout for side-by-side comparison.
- **Light & Dark Themes**  
  Toggleable themes powered by Tailwind v4 defaults.
- **Skip Recommendation Bot**  
  A small chatbot (using `react-chatbot-kit`) to guide users toward the right skip.
- **Fully Responsive**  
  Optimized for mobile and desktop browsers.

## Design Process

1. **Analysis & Inspiration**  
   Reviewed the original grid-based design, then brainstormed alternative layouts with ChatGPT and DeepSeek.  
2. **Timeline Concept**  
   Settled on a timeline format for clarity and visual interest, and implemented it in React.  
3. **Theme Support**  
   Added light and dark modes to match Tailwind CSS v4’s default theming with Vite.  
4. **Intelligent Guidance**  
   Built a mini chatbot to help users choose the correct skip size when they’re unsure.  
5. **Grid Enhancement**  
   After the timeline was complete, revisited the original grid to apply improvements and compare both approaches.
